# Apothicon Symbols

## why lol🗿
Made this default React site because i am to stupid to remeber the apothicon symbols<br/> on the revelations main Easter egg in Black Ops 3 Zombies🐇🐣.


## features
Just click the apothicon icon on the top and and it will output the same icon (But yellow🤯).

Click on the Shadows of Evil cures mark icon to reset the selected apothicon symbols 🎊.

Click more than four times and the selected icon will be reseted🙆‍♂️.

## installation
go to the frontend directory and type 
```
npm i
npm start 
```
